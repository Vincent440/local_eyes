This application takes a zipcode that the user enters and retrieves relevant data from multiple APIs to show information on the zipcode entered.

---

This app was designed around the idea that it is complicated to find information on specific locations, We used

* Weather 

* Goverment census data (Local and US)

* Hiking trails (within 100 miles)

* Zipcode data

* Yelp business information within (approximately 6 miles).

This page takes all of these sources of data and combines them into something the user can browse through on one webpage, with relevant links to the sources for more information.
